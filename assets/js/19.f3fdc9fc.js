Its main function is to create and maintain a globally unique identifier for a physical device within a certain range: the device ID. For a long time, ensuring the device ID's stability has been an important factor in measuring this product's excellence. Among them, the restoration ability and the uniqueness guarantee are the two most important indicators for stability evaluation. Restoration capability mainly refers to whether the device fingerprint can restore the original device ID of the device after the device state is changed. The uniqueness guarantee mainly refers to ensuring the uniqueness of the device identity code, at least within the scope of the system, and different devices are not allowed to share the same device ID.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("So how to ensure these two characteristics?")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("The product of device fingerprint has been jointly maintained by system providers and industry standards for a long time.

To meet the network equipment supervision policy, the equipment provider will preset the network access identifier of the equipment, such as IMEI, UUID, physical MAC address, etc., into the system. And because the laws and regulations related to personal privacy protection were not perfect at that time, there was no threshold for obtaining this information. Application developers could easily obtain these identifiers by calling the specified API. These identifiers are preset in the initial system of the device by the device manufacturer and the system provider and are defined according to local or international relevant protocol standards. It is precisely because these identifiers are bound by the official agreement and perform well in terms of uniqueness, and because they are preset inside the system, they are relatively safe and difficult to change when the source code is not disclosed. This device ID preset by the system is sufficient to support the use of most business scenarios, and the cost of obtaining these IDs is very low. But from another perspective, this also clarifies black industry practitioners' purpose. They only need to modify these important indicators to achieve the purpose of changing the device ID.

To solve these problems, third-party manufacturers have come up with some solutions. They are good at calculating device IDs through the active collection and comprehensive analysis. The device fingerprint at this stage will have a very purposeful tool development kit, which requires users to integrate it into their applications. The main purpose of this tool is to collect device information, including device software and hardware information, environmental network information, etc. After collecting these data, some indicators that combine stability and discreteness will be selected, and then the index relationship between indicators and device information will be established in the database. If it is a new device, a device ID is also generated. These device IDs are implemented through some low-collision rate algorithms, such as the snowflake algorithm, to ensure the uniqueness of the device ID.
