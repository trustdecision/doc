Its primary objective is to establish and maintain a globally unique identifier, known as the device ID, for a physical device within a specific range. The stability of the device ID plays a crucial role in assessing the effectiveness of this tool. To ensure stability, two key characteristics are essential: restoration capability and uniqueness guarantee. Restoration capability refers to the device fingerprint's ability to restore the original device ID even when the device's state has changed. On the other hand, the uniqueness guarantee ensures that each device possesses a distinct identity code, preventing device IDs from being shared among different devices within the system.</p> <h2 id="how-has-the-assurance-of-these-two-characteristics-evolved-over-time"><a href="#how-has-the-assurance-of-these-two-characteristics-evolved-over-time" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>How has the assurance of these two characteristics evolved over time?</strong></h2> <p>Device fingerprinting has undergone a remarkable evolution over the years, driven by the need for better user experience, heightened security, and increased applicability. In this context, TrustDecision, our cutting-edge device fingerprinting solution, has emerged as a leader in the industry, offering unique advantages that set it apart from conventional approaches.</p> <p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64035b5f27be9bd2bfb64a75/646b1bc083b4b1aa9015021d_the%20evolution%20of%20device%20fingerprint.jpg" alt="img"></p> <h4 id="the-initial-stage-of-opening-embracing-openness"><a href="#the-initial-stage-of-opening-embracing-openness" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>The Initial Stage of Opening: Embracing Openness</strong></h4> <p>During the early days, the environment was characterized by openness. Device manufacturers would preconfigure network access identifiers like IMEI, UUID, and physical MAC addresses into the system. Accessing these identifiers was straightforward for application developers through designated APIs. Although these identifiers were bound by official agreements and demonstrated uniqueness, they were susceptible to manipulation by malicious individuals. This period witnessed relatively low costs for black production attacks, and device fingerprints had yet to play a significant role in risk control processes.</p> <h4 id="the-development-stage-of-gradual-control-navigating-restriction"><a href="#the-development-stage-of-gradual-control-navigating-restriction" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>The Development Stage of Gradual Control: Navigating Restriction</strong></h4> <p>As operating systems matured, safeguarding personal data and managing permissions became paramount. System manufacturers started imposing restrictions on data access, making it challenging for developers to acquire original identification data from devices. To overcome these obstacles, third-party manufacturers introduced solutions that involved active collections and comprehensive analysis of device information. This led to the emergence of purpose-built device fingerprint toolkits that required integration into applications. These toolkits considered multiple stability and uniqueness indicators, resulting in enhanced overall stability and effectiveness in risk control measures.</p> <h4 id="the-stable-stage-of-strict-supervision-adapting-to-stringent-regulations"><a href="#the-stable-stage-of-strict-supervision-adapting-to-stringent-regulations" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>The Stable Stage of Strict Supervision: Adapting to Stringent Regulations</strong></h4> <p>In recent years, regulations and limitations on user data collection have become increasingly stringent.
